Hi . This program is a movie information finder.
We use api key to find any information we need about a movie or an actor.
I signed up in movie and celebrity database for get an api key and extract information as json.

I watched a youtube video to use it as an idea.

I completed ToDo sections and all movies test passed .
But the actors test isn,t !
The problem is in api key : {"error": "Missing API Key."}
I didn,t complete the main menu. ( i had many problems in get data from movies and actors class and print in main menu )

I tried so hard ...
